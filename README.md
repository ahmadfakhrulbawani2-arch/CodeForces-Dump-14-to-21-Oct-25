In case you find compilation error
Just change the compiler between G++17,  G++20, or G++23 for .cpp files
And there are no errors in .c files at all. I guarantee.
Short story, I commit 5 to 10 files everyday to grind my competitive programming skill using c/c++. Highest commit in a day is 17 Oct 2025 (18 commits)
